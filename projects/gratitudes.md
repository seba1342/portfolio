Gratitudes is a journalling app. It reminds you everyday via a notification to reflect on what you are grateful for. You can choose a time of day to be notified. Once the day is over you can no longer go back and change or add a gratitude entry from the past. This is an intentional design decision to keep you grounded in the present moment. My logic is: if you are wanting to add something for the past, then you are still grateful for it now.

There is no cloud/server backing to this app. Partly to simplify the architecture and also to maintain privacy of your entries. The entries never leave your phone unless _you_ explicitly export them.

You can download it here [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/gratitudes/id6444113905) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bailouni.gratitudes).

## Key Learnings

My main takeaway from this project was the learning how to release an app to the public. Managing beta testing groups, release versions, the marketing and bug fixes were all problems I had to learn to solve as they arose.
