Hello! This is my portfolio website that I use to showcase some work that I am
proud of. It is made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Run this locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
